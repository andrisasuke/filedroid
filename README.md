Google discontinued Android File Transfer for macOS. The alternatives are either slow, ugly, or cost money.

**FileDroid** is a free, open-source replacement built with Flutter. It connects to your Android device over USB via ADB and gives you a full file browser with drag-and-drop, real-time transfer progress, and a dark UI that actually looks good on your Mac.

## Features

- **Browse files** — Navigate your Android filesystem with breadcrumb navigation, back/forward history, and sortable columns (name, size, date, type)
- **Upload & Download** — Transfer files between Mac and Android with real-time progress, speed indicators, and transfer queue
- **Drag & Drop** — Drop files directly from Finder into any folder on your device
- **File management** — Create folders, rename files/folders, delete with confirmation — all via right-click context menu or toolbar
- **Quick Access sidebar** — Jump to Internal Storage, Downloads, Camera, Pictures, Documents, Music, or Movies in one click
- **Device info** — See device model, Android version, USB mode, and storage usage at a glance
- **Multi-file selection** — Select multiple files with checkboxes, batch download or delete
- **Hidden files toggle** — Show/hide dotfiles with one click
- **Cancel transfers** — Cancel in-progress or queued transfers anytime
- **Auto-detect ADB** — Finds ADB from Homebrew, Android Studio, or custom paths — with a guided setup if it's missing
- **Native macOS app** — Proper window chrome, title bar integration, and macOS-native feel

## Download

Grab the latest release from the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/andrisasuke/filedroid/releases/latest):

| File | Mac |
|---|---|
| `FileDroid-x.x.x-macOS-arm64.dmg` | Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) |
| `FileDroid-x.x.x-macOS-x86_64.dmg` | Intel |

> **macOS Gatekeeper:** Since the app is not code-signed, macOS will block it on first launch. After dragging to Applications, run:
> ```bash
> xattr -cr /Applications/FileDroid.app
> ```
> Or right-click the app → **Open** → click **Open** again.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **macOS** 12.0 or later
- **ADB** (Android Debug Bridge) — install via one of:
  ```bash
  # Homebrew (recommended)
  brew install android-platform-tools

  # Or install Android Studio — ADB is included
  ```
- **USB Debugging** enabled on your Android device
  > Settings > Developer Options > USB Debugging

### Install from Source

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/andrisasuke/filedroid.git
cd filedroid

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build the macOS app
flutter build macos

# The app is at: build/macos/Build/Products/Release/FileDroid.app
```

### Run in Development

```bash
flutter run -d macos
```

## How It Works

FileDroid communicates with your Android device through **ADB** (Android Debug Bridge) over USB. No network connection, no cloud, no accounts — just a direct cable connection.

1. Plug in your Android device via USB
2. Accept the "Allow USB debugging" prompt on your phone
3. FileDroid auto-detects the device and shows your files

All file operations (`ls`, `push`, `pull`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `rm`) are executed through ADB shell commands.

| Platform | macOS (desktop) |

| Drag & Drop | desktop_drop |
| File Picker | file_picker |
